# Car Parking Tracking System

This project implements a car parking tracking system using Python, OpenCV, and image processing techniques. It detects available parking spaces in a video feed and provides real-time visualization of the parking lot status.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Identifies free and occupied parking spaces in a video feed.
- **Interactive Configuration**: Allows you to set up and adjust parking space positions using a graphical interface.
- **Customizable Threshold**: Adjust the sensitivity to adapt to different lighting conditions or parking lot layouts.
- **Visualization**: Displays the number of free and total spaces on the video feed.

## Demo
